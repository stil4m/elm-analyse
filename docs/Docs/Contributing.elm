                In this guide I would like to help you not only bring Elm Analyse forward, but also in the right direction.
                I've listed a few points below that would help you get your contributions back into Elm Analyse.

            In the solution the goal should always be to create a solution that works for 'everyone'.
            Especially in the early days of this tool I would want to avoid circumstantial and highly configurable functionality.
            For example a check such as "Unused variables" is always valid.
            Disabling checks for a Module, a function or a single expression, is something that should not be at the core of this tool.
            In my (@stil4m) honest opinion, thinking about how we can write quality Elm code (and implement this in Elm Analyse) would help the Elm community forward much more,
            than creating a tool that contains the exact same functionality as other linters (ESLint for example).
